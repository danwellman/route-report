# Route Report

Automatically parse your Angular routing modules to extract the routes available within your app.

This package is intended to be run as part of a CI/CD pipeline or build process rather than as a module within your app. It can be installed with `npm install`, and can then be added to the `scripts` section of your package.json file:

    "scripts": {
      "routes": "node node_modules/route-report
    }

Do not try to import this package into another module.

*Please note*: Consider this package experimental/beta at this time. Your app should following standard Angular conventions, i.e. your app structure should look somewhat like this:

    /my-sweet-angular-app
      /app
        /src
          app-routing.module.ts
          /some-feature-module
            feature-routing.module.ts

Any deviation from standard Angular conventions is likely to result in this package not working as expected.

Features:
* Supports standard Angular routing setup as generated by the CLI.
* Supports one level of nested routes
* Outputs routes to the console

Future features:
* Support for non-standard routing configurations
* Unlimited nested route discovery
* HTML reporter
* Tests
